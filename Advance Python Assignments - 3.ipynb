    "### 3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create new class(Sub Class) upon the existing class(Super Class). If we need to add new features or behaviors while still keeping the old ones from the existing class (Super Class). If both the super class & sub class have __ init __ method we need to manually call a super class __ init __ method from the sub class __ init __ method. The reason is when we define __ init __ method in subclass it replaces superclass __ init __ method this means if the superclass __ init __ method contains important initialization code it won't be executed.\n",

    "### 4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can augment features or behavior without replacing the existing one.\n",
    "There are 2 simple ways to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Call the Super Class method* : In the subclass method start by calling the same method from the superclass using super().method_name() this ensures that original behavior is executed.\n",

    "\n",
    "* local scope of the function keeps variables limited to that functions block and they can't be accessed outside the function.\n",
    "* local scope of the classs method is similar in that variables defined withing the method are only accessible within the method. However class attributes defined directly within the class body are accessible through the class itself and its instances, providing a different level of visibility compared to function-local variables."
